	<p>PyPipboyApp is a platform independent and extensible unofficial Fallout 4 Pipboy Companion App written in Python3 using PyQt5. It can be extendet with additional widgets and styles.</p>
	<p>It natively works with the PC and PS4 version of Fallout. (See <a href="https://github.com/RobCoIndustries/pipboylib/issues/27#issuecomment-346986885">this</a> for a workaround for the Xbox version)</p>

	<h1>Usage</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that you have the Pipboy-App enabled in the game settings (and restarted the game after changing the settings).</li>
		<li>Connect to the game using "Auto Discovery" or "Connect to Host" from the "Program" sub-menu in the menu bar above.</li>
		<li>Enable/Disable individual widgets using the "Widgets" sub-menu in the menu bar above.</li>
		<li>Drag and drop the widgets around to customize your GUI layout.</li>
		<li>You can also detach widgets from the main-window (e.g. to show them on a different monitor).</li>
		<li>There is also the possibility to select a different visual style from the "Window" sub-menu in the menu bar above.</li>
		<li>The application remembers your GUI layout and your selected style when you close the application.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="autodochelp.html">Auto Doc</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Known Issues</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Fallout 4 does only allow one single connection at a time. This means you cannot connect the official app and this application at the same time.</li>
		<li>When Fallout 4 is in the background (e.g. because you pressed ALT+TAB), then it will accept a new connection, but not send any data until it is in the foreground again.</li>
		<li>Fallout 4 will not execute commands (e.g. fast travel, set/remove custom marker) when you are in the menu or the away-from-keyboard animation is playing.</li>
		<li>The local map looks scrambled? Then you probably need <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/644">this fix</a>.</li>
